The goal of this paper is to describe the algorithm that we are using
in PeakSegPipeline::problem.target in order to quickly compute the
target inteval, by only evaluating FPOP a few O(log N) times, even
when there are hundreds/thousands of desired peaks/segments.

** TODOs

** 19 Jan 2018

[[file:FPOP.models.R]] uses PeakSegPipeline to compute target intervals
for each labeled data set in the chip-seq benchmark. 

[[file:PDPA.models.R]] downloads precomputed PeakSegPDPA models and
computes target intervals for comparison with the FPOP models.
