The goal of this paper is to describe the algorithm that we are using
in PeakSegPipeline::problem.target in order to quickly compute the
target inteval, by only evaluating FPOP a few O(log N) times, even
when there are hundreds/thousands of desired peaks/segments.

** TODOs

compute test error differences using the three different target
intervals.

** 2 Feb 2018

[[file:FPOP.neuroblastoma.R]] computes the FPOP target interval,
gridsearch, and PDPA target interval, for the neuroblastoma data set.

[[file:figure-FPOP-gridsearch-compare.R]] plots the differences between
target intervals using proposed target interval search, and naive grid
search.

** 1 Feb 2018

[[file:FPOP.gridsearch.R]] computes a target interval based on a grid of
values that spans the FPOP target intervals (on average the same
number of FPOP evaluations as the target interval algo, the idea is to
show that it gets sub-optimal error/intervals in the same amount of
computation time).

** 26 Jan 2018

[[file:figure-FPOP-PDPA-compare.R]] computes and plots differences between
the target intervals in FPOP and PDPA.

** 19 Jan 2018

[[file:FPOP.models.R]] uses PeakSegPipeline to compute target intervals
for each labeled data set in the chip-seq benchmark. 

[[file:PDPA.models.R]] downloads precomputed PeakSegPDPA models and
computes target intervals for comparison with the FPOP models.
